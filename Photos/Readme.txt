This folder contains photos of the assembled battery pack.

The pack is stronger when printed laying on the bed of the printer with the open side down using supports.  A bit of light sanding is required to remove all support materials.

The tabs are made from a sheet of .10 tin, formed and bent to fit the battery pack.  More details on this will be released as available along with a printable cut guide to create these parts.  This is a work in progress.

This pack has available cutouts for a thermistor pad, so that you can add a 10k thermistor to support pack charging.  The newton will not charge a pack without this component!  as soon as I test and source this I will post an amazon link.
