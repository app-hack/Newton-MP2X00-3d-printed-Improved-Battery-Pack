https://www.littelfuse.com/products/fuses-overcurrent-protection/polyswitch-resettable-pptc-devices/battery-strap/lr4/lr4-190f

Old PDF uploaded for reference as well as replacement.

The new version actually cuts out power faster than the old version allowing more protection.

There is a direct bourns replacement fuse but this is only available in high quantities.
